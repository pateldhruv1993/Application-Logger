# CONFIGURATIONS FOR APPLICATION LOGGER
#
# This file contains several configurations used by Application Logger. You can change them at will.
# They will not become active until Application Logger is restarted, however.
#
# If this file is deleted, it will be rewritten with the default values.
#
# All fields follow, with a description of what each of them does.
#

# Template for the file path in which logs will be saved.
#
# * This is either relative to the executable path, or an absolute path.
#
# * If the file or path doesn't exist, it will be created.
#
# * Some variables are accepted, and replace the file where convenient:
#
#   [[year]] : current year e.g: 2014
#   [[month]] : current month of the year (starting at 1), e.g: 03, 12
#   [[day]] : current day of the month (starting at 1), e.g: 01, 28
#   [[machine]] : current machine name (useful when saving logs to a network drive or shared space of some kind, like dropbox)
#
# Examples:
#   path=appLog.log
#   path=logs\[[year]]_[[month]].log
#   path=c:\logs\app\[[year]]\[[month]]\[[day]].log
#

path=logs\[[year]]_[[month]]_[[machine]].log


# The time, in seconds, that the computer has to be idle for the user to be considered away.
#
# Examples:
#   idleTime=600
#

idleTime=600

# The interval, in seconds, for verifying whether the user is in a new application or document.
#
# Examples:
#   checkInterval=0.5
#

checkInterval=0.5


# The maximum number of log entries that can be queued at any time before they are committed to the log file.
#
# Generally this should be a very high number, since it's more predictable to let it save to the file based on time (maxQueueTime) instead.
#
# Examples:
#   maxQueueEntries=1000
#

maxQueueEntries=1000


# The maximum amount of time that can pass, in seconds, before the current log entries (if any) are committed to the log file.
#
# Examples:
#   maxQueueTime=300
#

maxQueueTime=300


################################  IPC - TCP Stuff  #############################
# 
# Set the server address and port for IPC
#
# Examples:
#   serverAddress=127.0.0.1
#	serverPort=6969
#

serverAddress=127.0.0.1
serverPort=6969


# Maximum number of attempts this App should make to connect with the TCP server for IPC
#  NOTE: If you set this to 0 (Zero) it means make unlmited number of attempts to connect till this app is running
#
# Examples:
#   maxTCPAttempts=0
#

maxTCPAttempts=5


# How frequently should the app read the TCP stream for instructions
#  NOTE: This is bottle necked by the checkInterval value so no point in setting it lower than that
#
# Examples:
#   TCPInterval=0
#

TCPInterval=0


# This is the max number of most recent logs the program will store no matter what
#
# Examples:
#   maxLogCache=10
#

maxLogCache=10
